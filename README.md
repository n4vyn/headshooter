## About The Project
Simple 2d browser shooting game. Shoot enemy heads, gain money, buy upgrades, shoot more enemy heads.
I started making it just for fun, as a bit of a meme, I just wanted to test my skills and see if I would be capable of making a small game like this.  
*The current head textures are pictures of me and my friend, though I won't tell you which is which :p*

## How To Run
If you have a web server, just drag and drop the src folder there.  
If you don't have a web server and want to run it locally, do:
```
npm i
npm run start
```
